      Running is an excellent way to clear your head or catch up on your
      favorite TV shows. Whether on a treadmill with a screen for entertainment
      or outdoors in a park to enjoy nature, running offers a range of
      enjoyment. Each environment has its own appeal, indoor running allows for
      catching up on your favorite shows, while outdoor running lets you immerse
      yourself in nature.

    <p>
      Lifting, a necessity and usually a great time to read, explore new music,
      or dive into podcasts. Some of my favorite genres to listen to during this
      time are hard rock and hip-hop. As for podcasts, I often enjoy Ginger
      Whiskey or Lenny's Podcast, depending on what I'm interested in at the
      moment.

      First up is Naruto. It's not something I watch much these days, but it was
      on often while I was growing up, sparking my love for anime. Not all
      anime, of course, some of my favorites are Bleach, Fire Force, and Jujutsu
      Kaisen. When new episodes are released, these 25 minute blocks are a
      perfect way to add a bit of fun to the day. Other favorites include SEAL
      Team, Lincoln Lawyer, Outer Banks, and Marvel movies. These shows and
      movies are a great way to take a break in a busy schedule.
