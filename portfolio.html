        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Aaron grew up in a small town near Athens, Georgia, where community
          events were a regular part of life. The town held numerous annual and
          monthly gatherings that brought everyone together for concerts, Relay
          for Life events, football games, parades, and more. During these
          years, Aaron formed many lasting friendships, with several friends
          still close to him today. He was actively involved in Sunday School
          and weekly youth events, where he met his best friends, and he spent
          many seasons playing baseball. Outside of these activities, Aaron
          developed a love for anime that has stayed with him into adulthood.

        <h2>Early Adult Years</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          During his early adult years, Aaron moved to Atlanta to attend Georgia
          State University. Where he studied Philosophy. While working at a golf
          club, he met many great people and received valuable advice, much of
          which he'll carry throughout his career. Surprisingly, he didn't pick
          up golf as a hobby, though he enjoys competitive matches of Golden
          Tee. His time as a bartender there also developed a valuable skillset
          he continues to use today.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Aaron has built a strong foundation in his career and is now focused
          on honing his skills as a software developer, with aspirations to
          become a digital product manager. He began as an Assistant Project
          Manager for EV Charger installations, then transitioned to Service
          Manager, where he gained valuable experience in Network Operations,
          Maintenance, and Customer Service. With a passion for software
          development, design, and strategy, Aaron had the opportunity to work
          alongside experience designers and software developers on the
          company's newly established Product Team. To accelerate his path
          toward product management, he enrolled in Emory's Coding Bootcamp,
          equipping himself with the skills to fast-track his goals.

        <h2>Adult Life</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Currently, Aaron devotes most of his time to his career. Outside of
          work and coding studies, he stays active through weightlifting and
          running. Running on the treadmill doubles as a chance to catch up on
          his favorite shows, like The Lincoln Lawyer. Occasionally, Aaron
          spends time with friends, usually nearby, playing card games or
          joining a poker night. He also enjoys early 2000s sitcoms as his go-to
          comfort shows. While he wishes he had more time for video games, he
          rarely finds the chance to enjoy them.
